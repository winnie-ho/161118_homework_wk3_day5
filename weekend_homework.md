##CodeClan Cinema (CCC(I know, it's overused.)) 

Create a software that handles bookings for our newly built cinema! 
It's enough if you can call your methods in pry!

###Your app should have:
  - Customers
    - name
    - funds

  - Films
    - title
    - price

  - Tickets
    - customer_id
    - film_id

###Your app should be able to:
  - Create customers, films and tickets
  - CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) customers, films and tickets.

###Basic extensions:
  - Buying tickets should decrease the funds of the customer by the price
  - Check how many tickets were bought by a customer
  - Check how many customers are going to watch a certain film

###Advanced extensions:
  - Add a new 'time' row for the tickets
    - Write a method that finds out what is the most popular time (most tickets sold) for a given film
  - Add a limit to available tickets.
  - Add any other extensions you think would be great to have at a cinema!
